 . The handler is started up.
 . The handler's synchronizer lock is acquired.
 . The handler is registered on the given event-loop.
 . An event is issued with the event-type and initargs onto the event-loop.
 . Now the thread waits on the handler's condition variable.
 . Once the thread is reawakened before the timeout it binds the event
   from the handler and the specified slot variables, then proceeds to
   evaluate the body.
 . As a cleanup, the handler is deregistered and stopped.

The handler itself performs the following steps once it HANDLEs an event:
 . Acquire the one-time-handler exclusive lock.
 . Save the event on its own slot.
 . Acquire the synchronizer lock and immediately release it again to ensure
   that the issuing thread is waiting on the condition variable.
 . Notify the condition variable.

  ((with-fuzzy-slot-bindings)
   "Establishes a binding context similar to WITH-SLOTS and WITH-ACCESSORS but using the most appropriate way to access a slot, and a fuzzy manner of identifying slots.

Each VAR can either be a list of NAME SLOT-ISH, or simply the SLOT-ISH which will be used as the name as well.

You must pass the class explicitly since we have to be able to analyse the slots of the class during compile time.
